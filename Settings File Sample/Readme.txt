Keep your notes in a drive which is secured from deletion.
If you keep it in C drive and forgetfully format the c drive
while installing windows( something like that) you notes
will be lost. So try to keep it in other drives such as d drive.
Or you can choose a cloud drive like Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive.

Settings.txt file must be in the same folder from where
this program runs.
