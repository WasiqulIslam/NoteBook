By just changing the settings file,
this program can be customized by changing the Settings.txt file.
Here are some samples.

Note: if the Settings.txt file
is invalid, the program may not run properly.

Keep your notes in a drive which is secured from deletion.
If you keep it in C drive and forgetfully format the c drive
while installing windows( something like that) you notes
will be lost. So try to keep it in other drives such as d drive.


Settings.txt file must be in the same folder from where
this program runs(where the Run.bat file is kept).
