ADVANCED:

You can customize your copy of this program
using the Settings.txt file.
Before modifying the settings file keep a backup copy
of the original file; as invalid setting file may cause this
program to not work.
In the settings file, every first line is a key
and second line is the value of that key.
Do not change the key, only change the value
(the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th line, and so on )
Encryption technique is used in the program.
This makes your files ambiguous to others.
Change the encryption password if needed
but change the password only once
(before you have started to use this program).
Or you can change the value of the key: "useDefaultEncryptionPassword"
to "no".
In that case, this program will always
prompt you for entering password(key) every time this
program is run.
It is upto you whether you keep your password in
settings file or provide it every time
this program runs.
If you do not change the settings file at all
this program will use the key "password"
as a password(according to the default settings).
You can also change the date/time format if you like.


WARNING:
If password(key) is invalid then the letters will be
in a format which is not readable by you.
In that case, do not save the document;
Otherwise that document will be corrupted.
So, if needed keep a backup of your notes.

Password Note: If you are sure that your pc is secure,
you can keep your password in Settings.txt file.
